I actually follow Traversy Media in the header just to check his thought process and observe why this and that, but when the Flexbox suddenly clicked on my head, I started undoing the stuff and grinding till the footer without actually coding along or checking someone's code. I only googled 2â€“4 items, and that's it.

Realizing is the best, but I probably will forget it tomorrow, but I can just regain it and practice, so it's not a big deal.
